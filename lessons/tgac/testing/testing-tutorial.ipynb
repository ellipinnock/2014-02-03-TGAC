If we are working on a large project over three years and end up with 100s of functions, it may be hard to remember what each function does in detail. If we have a test that checks all of the function's functionality, we can look at the test to remember what it's supposed to do.\n",

      "Traditionally, we'd write our code, then write the tests. [Test driven development](http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-By-Example/dp/0321146530) (TDD), proposed by Kent Beck, is a philosophy that turns this on its head - we write code by *writing the tests first*, then write the code to make the tests pass. If a new feature is needed, another test is written and the code is expanded to meet this new use case. This continues until the code does what is needed. This can be summarised as red-green-refactor:\n",
